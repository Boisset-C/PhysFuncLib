LINEAR KINEMATICS

"Linear kinematics" refers to the branch of physics that studies the motion of objects moving along a straight line, focusing on parameters like displacement, velocity, and acceleration without considering the forces causing the motion; essentially, it describes the "geometry of motion" in a straight line trajectory. - Wikipedia
